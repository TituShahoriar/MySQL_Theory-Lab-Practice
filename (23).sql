23.How do you use transactions in MySQL? Explain the ACID properties.
Transactions in MySQL are used to ensure data consistency and integrity. A transaction is a sequence of one or more database operations that are treated as a single unit of work.

ACID properties stand for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability:

Atomicity: All operations within a transaction are treated as a single unit, either all of them are committed, or none of them are.
Consistency: A transaction brings the database from one consistent state to another. It ensures that data follows defined rules and constraints.
Isolation: Each transaction is isolated from others, and its changes are not visible to other transactions until it is committed.
Durability: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and survive any subsequent system failures.
To use transactions in MySQL, you can use the BEGIN, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK statements.

Example:

sql

BEGIN; -- Start a transaction

-- Perform database operations

COMMIT; -- Commit the transaction

-- Or in case of an error or rollback:

ROLLBACK; -- Roll back the transaction
